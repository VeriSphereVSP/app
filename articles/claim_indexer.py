      Phase 2 — call embed() per candidate to score relevance. No DB

      Phase 3 — issue a single batched DELETE for the doomed rows,

    Conservative criterion: only removes sentences whose text byte-
    equals the on-chain claim_text (i.e. were INSERTED by the indexer
    rather than merely overlaid onto an existing LLM-generated
    sentence). Overlaid sentences carry a post_id but their text is
