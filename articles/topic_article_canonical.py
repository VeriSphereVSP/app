"""app/articles/topic_article_canonical.py — one-article-per-topic enforcement.

Two halves:

  RESOLUTION (write path): resolve_article_for_topic_id() — get-or-create an
  article keyed on the centroid-resolved topic_id, NOT on a fuzzy topic string.
  This is what ensure_article_for_claim should have used; string prefix-matching
  is what let "January 6" / "6th" / "6th insurrection" become three articles for
  one semantic topic.

  SELF-HEALING (worker): reconcile_topic_articles() — find any topic_id bound to
  >1 article, collapse to a single canonical article (regenerate clean prose,
  re-inject ALL staked claims from every duplicate, retire the extras). Runs on
  the worker loop. Every deletion is logged and alerted. Keyed strictly on
  topic_id (disambiguated identity) — NEVER on name — so two same-named /
  different-meaning topics (distinct centroids -> distinct topic_id) are never
  fused. A verification asserts the topic COUNT is unchanged by any collapse:
  we merge articles, never topics.

Claim-preservation invariant (same as the article-inject fixes): no staked
claim (a sentence carrying a post_id) is ever dropped; every one is re-homed to
the canonical article before any duplicate article is deleted.
