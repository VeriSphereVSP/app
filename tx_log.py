# app/tx_log.py
"""
Tx-log helper: record, look up, and update entries in the tx_log table.

Used by:
  - /api/relay/async (relay.py) to record pending transactions on submission
  - chain_indexer.resolve_pending_txs to mark rows confirmed/reverted/dropped
  - /api/notifications/{address} (notifications.py) to query user history

All functions take an SQLAlchemy Session and assume the caller manages
the transaction. None of these helpers call db.commit() — the caller
decides when to commit.

Status transitions:
   inserted as → pending
   pending     → confirmed   (receipt.status == 1)
   pending     → reverted    (receipt.status == 0)
   pending     → dropped     (receipt not found after TX_PENDING_TIMEOUT)
