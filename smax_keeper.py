"""app/smax_keeper.py — patch_smax_keeper

S-03 layer (ii), operational half. Core's PR-C (#14) made StakeEngine.refreshSMax
permissionless: anyone can settle a post and feed its TRUE stored total into the
sMax leader tracker. This module is the party that volunteers: once per cycle it
checks whether the on-chain sMax has deviated from reality and pokes when — and
only when — a transaction would actually change something.

WHY THIS EXISTS (architecture note, recorded deliberately):
  Accrual is lazy, so a dormant post's true total does not exist on-chain until
  someone settles it. No tracker, however wide, can see a number that has never
  been materialized — the deviation is a property of lazy accrual, not of the
  tracker. Core therefore guarantees I.4 for TRACKED posts and makes the residue
  CLOSEABLE BY ANYONE (the permissionless poke). This keeper makes "anyone"
  scheduled instead of hoped-for. It is NOT privileged infrastructure: if this
  worker dies, any user interaction or any third party's refreshSMax call closes
  the same gap, and the failure mode is fairness (one dormant post earning the
  rMax ceiling instead of a participation-scaled rate — a rate the protocol
  already permits), never solvency. Mainnet graduation path: register the same
  poke with Chainlink Automation / Gelato so liveness doesn't depend on one
  container; this worker then becomes the backup.

COST MODEL (measured against core's test gas numbers):
  A poke that settles a dormant post runs ~150k–500k gas depending on ranked-
  queue depth; a poke on an already-settled post is ~50–80k (tracker feed only).
  The decision logic below sends AT MOST a handful of transactions per epoch and
  usually zero: deviations are closed when seen, and decay is materialized at
  most once per epoch. On Avalanche gas prices this is single-digit dollars per
  month at the high end. The keeper wallet holds ONLY gas AVAX — no protocol
  funds, no privileges (relay-key-separation posture, see relay_wallet.py).

DECISION RULES per cycle (pure function `_decide`, unit-tested without a chain):
  1. DEVIATION: some candidate post's (projected) total exceeds on-chain sMax
     -> poke the largest such post. Re-check after each poke; cap per cycle.
     Not epoch-gated: a visible I.4 deviation is closed whenever seen.
  2. DECAY MATERIALIZATION: no deviation, but sMax sits above every candidate
     total and its bookkeeping epoch is stale -> poke the largest candidate,
     at most ONCE per epoch (cursor in chain_indexer_state), so decay ticks
     down smoothly instead of lumping at the 30-epoch catch-up cap.
  3. Otherwise: no transaction. Most cycles land here.

CANDIDATES come from the indexer's own chain_post table (top N by indexed
totals) — the DB is only a shortlist filter; every decision input is re-read
from the chain, so indexer staleness can delay a poke but never cause a wrong
one. refreshSMax itself can only feed a post's true stored total, so the worst
this keeper can ever do on-chain is make sMax more honest.

CONFIGURATION (all env; fail-IDLE, not fail-loud — this is an optional
maintenance job, unlike the relay which sits in the user tx path):
  KEEPER_KMS_KEY / KEEPER_ADDRESS   GCP KMS key resource + expected EOA, same
                                    ceremony as RELAY/MM (signing/kms_account).
                                    Both unset -> keeper logs once and idles.
  KEEPER_INTERVAL_SEC        cycle interval          (default 900)
  KEEPER_CANDIDATES          shortlist size          (default 10 = TRACKED_POSTS)
  KEEPER_MAX_POKES_PER_CYCLE deviation-poke cap      (default 3)
  KEEPER_EPOCH_SEC           epoch length in seconds (default 86400, must match
                             core EPOCH_LENGTH; used for epoch arithmetic only)
  KEEPER_MIN_BALANCE_WEI     low-gas alert threshold (default 5e17 = 0.5 AVAX)

Heavy imports (web3, KMS, db) are deliberately lazy so importing this module —
and running its pure-logic tests — needs nothing but the standard library.
